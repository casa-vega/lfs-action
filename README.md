# lfs-action

This is an example repo for performing an LFS migration on GitHub via actions using workflow dispatch. All you have to do is provide file extensions to via workflow dispatch (\*.jpg,*.png).

⚠️ Note, this action example can be destructive so it's recommended you try on a test repo or a fork of the project first. In the future we'll add more guard rails to prevent issues.
